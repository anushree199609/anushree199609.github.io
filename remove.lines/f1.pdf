.1.1 Knowledge Nature 
Knowing is one of the most specific human processes and knowledge is its 
result.  That  means that  knowing  and knowledge  have  been subjects  of 
human inquiry from  the ancient  times.  Philosophers,  starting  with  Plato 
and Aristotle developed Epistemology as a theory of knowledge, trying to 
answer  to  the  fundamental  question:  What  is  knowledge?There  were 
many answers and many arguments used in supporting them, but none of 
those theories has been accepted so far as being fully satisfactory. Defin-
ing knowledge and explaining its nature proved to be elusive and without 
a  convincing  and universally  accepted result  (Neta and  Pritchard 2009; 
Russell 1972). Most of the theories have been integrated into two major 
perspectives:  rationalism  and empiricism.  Simplifying, we  may  say  that 
both theories accept that knowledge is a justified true belief, but they de-
part in showing the ways through which one can find the truth or justify-
ing the true belief.  
  Rationalism,  for  which  Plato is a  pioneering  philosopher,  argues 
thatknowledge is a result of a reasoning process and that our sensory ex-
perience  plays no  role.  Knowledge  can  be  obtained  only from  rational 
reasoning grounded in axioms, like in mathematics, and it should be  dis-
tinguished from  opinion  which is  a product  of our senses.  In  his  theory 
about ideas, Plato makes a difference between a “cat” which represents a 
particular object in the real world and the concept of “cat” coming from 
the eternal world of cattyness. While the real “cat” is born and sometimes 
will  die,  the  concept  of  “cat”  remains  in  the  eternal  world  of  ideas. 
Knowledge  belongs  to that  eternal  world. Explaining  the Plato’s  frame-
work of knowledge, Bertrand Russell  (1972,  p.152) shows that “We per-
ceive hard and soft through touch, but it is the mind that judges that they 
3 
exist and that they are contraries. Only the mind can reach existence, and 
we cannot reach truth if we do not reach existence”. We cannot know the 
real world through senses alone since they can mislead us. In conclusion, 
“knowledge consists  in reflection, not in  impressions,  and  perception is 
not  knowledge” (Russel,  1972; p.153).  We may  agree  with  Plato  when 
discussing about  mathematics and mathematical propositions. To under-
stand  that  y  =  a +  bx  reflects  a  correlation  between  two  variables  we 
don’t  need any  sensory  perception. We  need only  a reasoning  process 
with abstract symbols. But that is just a particular domain of science and 
cannot be generalized over the whole human existence.  
  René Descartes made rationalism the basis of modern philosophy 
by integrating in his conceptual universe many new scientific discoveries. 
He founded the famous method of doubting everything and searching for 
certainty: “I can do nothing else, until I have learned for certain that there 
is nothing in the world that is certain” (Descartes, 1997; p. 139). By ana-
lyzing  comparatively  his thoughts coming  from  the  mind and  the  infor-
mation coming from the  sensory  system,  Descartes  reached  the  conclu-
sion that thought is the only attribute that belongs to him that cannot be 
detached of him: “What of thinking? I find here that thought is an attrib-
ute that belongs to me; it alone cannot be separated from me. I am, I ex-
ist,  that  is certain” (Descartes,  1997;  p. 141). That  means that the  only 
test of our existence is the fact that we think and through thinking we ac-
quire  knowledge.  In his  famous  formulation  “Cogito,  ergo  sum!”,  mind 
and body  are like  two different worlds, and  while  bodily sensations fail 
the reliability test, thinking proves to be the unique characteristic that  is 
reliable and certain. Finally, he remarks: “I am, however, a real thing and 
really exist; but what thing? I have answered: a thing which thinks” (Des-
cartes, 1997; p.  142). This dualism of mind and body had a great  impact 
on science, philosophy and education in Europe, and later on in America. 
Even today, many authors consider knowledge to be rational and  based 
on solely mental processes.  
  Empiricism emerged as an opposable  perspective to rationalism. 
Aristotle, a former student of Plato, considered that ideas and forms can-
not  be  separated  from  physical  objects  and  sensory  information.

Knowledge  is  not  created  a  priori  and  is  not  innate  in  a  deterministic 
form. It is created through our sensory interface with the real world, and 
it is  processed  finally  by our mind.  John  Locke  continued that  approach 
emphasizing that objects do exist in the outer world and that our sensory 
perception  is  the most  important  source  of  our  knowledge.  Many con-
temporary philosophers tried to bridge the gap between rationalism and 
empiricism by generating conceptual frameworks based on different syn-
theses between them.  
  In sharp  contrast  with the Cartesian  dualism  of mind and body, 
the Japanese intellectual tradition based on Buddhism and Confucianism 
created an integrated perspective of mind and body with three overarch-
ing premises (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; p. 27): “(1) oneness of humani-
ty and nature; (2) oneness of body and mind; and (3) oneness of self and 
other. These traits have formed the foundation of the  Japanese view to-
ward knowledge as well as the Japanese approach  toward  management 
practices”.  That  means that knowledge  is  rooted in the  sensory  system 
and only  in  its  final processing  stage  is open  to abstract  considerations. 
Their relation with  the  real world is through their  senses and they don’t 
need to make appeal to any eternal or metaphysical world in order to un-
derstand the  nature  of knowledge. Mind and  body  are  not two distinct 
realities  but an  integrated  one  which  creates  the  whole  personality  of 
people.  “For  the  Japanese,  knowledge  means  wisdom  that  is  acquired 
from  the  perspective  of  the  entire  personality.  This  orientation  has 
proved a basis for valuing personal and physical experience over indirect, 
intellectual  abstraction”  (Nonakaand  Takeuchi,  1995;  p.  29).  This  inte-
grated view can be seen in the samurai education, where internal medita-
tion was used together with physical training, and in the knowledge man-
agement practices developed within Japanese companies where the focus 
is on tacit knowledge which reflects the best people’s direct experience. It 
is  interesting  to  see  how  Miyamoto  Musashi,  the  legendary  Japanese 
martial artist, emphasizes in his famous Book of five rings the importance 
of learning with the whole body the correct motion during a fight (Kauf-
man,  1994;  p.  31): “Proper movement of  the  body depends  entirely on 
the manner in which you carry yourself. The feet carry the body and the 
5 
body directs the feet. Tread firmly with the heel touching the ground first 
and then roll forward  to the ball of your foot.  Practice this until you ap-
pear to move without motion”.  
1.1.2 Knowledge Definition 
 
As  mentioned  before,  a  frequently  adopted  definition  of  knowledge  is 
that of “justified true belief” (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; p.87). That def-
inition incorporates three basic  conditions,  fact  for which  some authors 
call it  the  tripartite  account  of knowledge.  These conditions  are  the  fol-
lowing (Neta and Pritchard, 2009). 
 The truth condition. It requires that if one knows a proposition then 
that proposition must be true. If the proposition is not true, then that 
person does not know what he claims to know. The truth condition 
makes the difference between opinion and knowledge. 
 The belief condition. That condition demands that if one knows a prop-
osition then he believes that proposition.  
 The justification condition. That condition requires a practical way of 
justifying that the belief one has is true.  
Putting together these conditions for knowing, one may conclude 
that “the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowing that something 
is the case  are first that what one is said to know be true,  secondly that 
one be sure of  it,  and thirdly that one should  have the right to be sure” 
(Ayer, 2009; p. 13). The right to be sure can be earned in different ways 
which are culturally and contextual dependent. These conditions are usu-
ally synthesized in a logical format. Considering S to be the subject or the 
knower, P to be the proposition the subject is supposed to know, one may
